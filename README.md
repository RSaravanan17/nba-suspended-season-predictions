## Predicting data for the suspended 2019-20 NBA season

#### Due to the widespread impact of COVID-19 throughout the world, almost every comapny, organization, and public event has been canceled or suspended for the forseeable future. Many of these activities are moving to a virtual format if possible, but several others have been forced to shut down.

#### As avid sports fans, the absence of the major sporting events during this time has hit us and many others around the world especially hard. A full list of all sporting events canceled around the world during the coronavirus can be found [here](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/28824781/list-sporting-events-canceled-coronavirus). Some of the events that we particularly were looking forward to include the NBA, NCAA March Madness, MLB, and the 2020 Summer Olympics.

#### In our curiosity, we decided to utilize this opportunity to exercise some data science and modeling skills we have picked up in order to predict what could have been. Specifically, we focused on the NBA and the NBA Playoffs. Since the 2019-2020 NBA season was suspended approximately one month prior to the end of the regular season (and beginning of the playoffs), we used the 2019-2020 season data accumulated from the games played before the suspension to predict how the season and the playoffs would have ended had everything gone according to schedule.

#### Our analysis was based on calculating Elo ratings for each team. To learn more about the Elo rating system, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).
